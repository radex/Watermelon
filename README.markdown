#Watermelon CMS

**Watermelon CMS** is my small (well, second largest I've ever written) project of fast, convenient, and flexible *content management system* with very good (at least by design) quality code. I started it back in 2007 *for learning purposes*, rewriten in 2008, and then abandoned in 2009. I reactivated it in 2010, because I couldn't find CMS meeting my requirements. I'm going to rewrite some parts, and change some of design. Then I'm going to use it on my blog, and let other people download it *for free* (hurray). I'm not really looking for someone to help me, however if you write or fix something (which I *seriously* doubt anyone will do) you can let me know.

PS. It's mostly only a github README.
